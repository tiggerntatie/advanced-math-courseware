PROJECT: Making the Shot... or Not?
===================================

.. topic:: Scenario

    In this project, you will be analyzing a portion of a video of a student
    throwing a ball at a "basket." You will use mathematics and Logger Pro
    to determine if the student made the shot.
    
    In class, you and a partner will create a video of your attempt to make a 
    "basket." This will be analyzed by students in another class.

Practice Questions
------------------

Following are several questions involving 
**parabolic** trajectories of projectiles. After you record your attempt to 
make a basket, work through these problems. Next, with your partner, brainstorm
a strategy for your approach to the ball toss problem.

------------

A projectile is launched from the ground. At t=3 seconds, it reaches its 
maximum height of 144 feet.

1. At what time *t* will it hit the ground?

A projectile is launched from a height of 24.5 meters. At t=2 seconds, it 
reaches its maximum height of 44.1 meters.

2. At what time *t* will the projectile reach a height of 24.5 meters again?
3. At what time *t* will the projectile hit the ground?

A basketball is tossed from the free throw line with an initial speed of 
25 m/s. The initial angle is 60 |deg|.

4. What is the initial velocity in the *horizontal* direction?
5. What is the initial velocity in the *vertical* direction?

After you receive a video to analyze, you and your partner may begin the 
project:

Part I: The Video
-----------------

* Download the video to your computer.
* Open Logger Pro and use the *insert/movie* menu to insert the video into 
  a new project.
* Press the button in the lower right hand corner of the video window to begin
  video analysis.
* Set the **scale** and **origin** for your analysis (the origin may be placed
  anywhere, but some locations may be more useful than others).
* Advance the video to the beginning of the ball toss motion (your video may
  already be there at the start).
* Double-click on the video and check the box: "First VA point defines movie 
  time zero."
* **Add points** using the point tool.

Part II: The Math
-----------------

Use Logger Pro and your knowledge of quadratic and parametric equations to 
define functions that model the following (**SHOW ALL WORK!**):

* :math:`x(t)`: the horizontal position of the ball as a function of time.
* :math:`y(t)`: the vertical position of the ball as a function of time.
* :math:`y(x)`: the vertical position of the ball as a function of the
  horizontal position.
  
Logger Pro automatically displays the **initial velocity** both *horizontally*
and *vertically* in a table. Use this information and your knowledge of right
triangles to determine the following:

* At what angle was the ball launched (with respect to horizontal)?
* At what speed was the ball launched?

Part III: The Analysis
----------------------

Use your equations from Part II and your knowledge of quadratic equations to
decide if the student made the shot or not. **SHOW ALL WORK!**

Part IV: The Summary
--------------------

Write up a summary of your work (typed):

* A paragraph to **frame** the problem.
* A paragraph describing your **method** for solving the problem (more than 
  "we will use Logger Pro and math...").
* A **concluding** paragraph (**state** and **justify** whether or not the 
  student made the shot!)

.. topic:: SUBMIT (graded as a quiz)

    * `Practice Questions`_, completed with all work shown (**one per student**).
    * Final Report (**one per group**):
        1. Front page: typed summary (`Part IV: The Summary`_).
        2. Answers to questions (x(t), y(t), y(x), angle, speed) and **work**
           (`Part II: The Math`_).
        3. Analysis, including **work**! (`Part III: The Analysis`_) (one per group).
