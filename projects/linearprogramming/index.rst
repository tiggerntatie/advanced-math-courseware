PROJECT: Going to Extremes - An Investigation In Linear Programming
===================================================================

Part I: Maximize Profit
-----------------------

.. topic:: Scenario:

    It's that time of year! The Class of 2015 is selling gourmet candy as a
    fundraiser. They offer two different gift packages: The Classic (two
    chocolate-covered strawberries and four assorted chocolate truffles)
    and The Sweetheart (five chocolate-covered strawberries and five
    assorted chocolate truffles). They sell The Classic for $5.00 and The
    Sweetheart for $10.00.

    If 600 chocolate covered strawberries are purchased for $300 and 800
    truffles are purchased for $200, what is the maximum profit the Class of
    2015 could make?

Gather Restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The scenario contains a lot of information! Let's organize it in your notebook:

:doc:`4<practice/A.4s>`, :doc:`5<practice/A.5s>`, :doc:`6<practice/A.6s>`



What are the UNKNOWNS? We know how many strawberries and truffles we have
available. We know the profit for each Classic or Sweetheart gift package.
We do NOT know how many Classic or Sweetheart gift packages the class could
make with the available candies, so we can assign variables to represent
the number of Classic or Sweetheart gift packages.

Maximizing Profit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Although the shaded region contains every possible solution to the system of inequalities,
we are interested in the solution that yields the *maximum profit*.

From `Gather Restrictions`_ you determined the profit per Classic and Sweetheart
gift package.

Solutions: :doc:`10<practice/A.10s>`, :doc:`11<practice/A.11s>`,
:doc:`12<practice/A.12s>`

:math:`P(x,y)` is called an **objective function** because it addresses our objective
of finding the maximum profit.

Corner Point Principle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Although any coordinate in the feasible region will be a solution to our system, it has
been shown that for any objective function, the maximum or minum value of that
objective function will *always* occur at a corner point (think about *why* that might
be true).

Therefore, we have to test only the coordinates of the corners (vertices) in our objective
function - whichever gives the maximum value of *P* will be our solution.

Part II: Minimize Time
----------------------

.. topic:: Scenario:

    Hanover High School has received a grant to start a community srvice program
    for its juniors and seniors. They would like to send out teams of juniors
    and seniors with faculty advisors to volunteer at the local library and the
    local elementary school. The library has an after school reading program which
    would require teams of 3 juniors, 3 seniors, and one advisor for two hours
    twice a week. The elementary school has a one-on-one tutoring program after
    school which would require teams of 8 juniors, 4 seniors, and two advisors
    for two hours three times per week. In order to run the community service
    program, the school needs to have at least 40 juniors, 28 seniors, and 12
    faculty members involved.

    What is the total *minimum* number of hours that all the teams could work?
    How many volunter teams for the library and elementary school would there be?


.. topic:: Submit:

    Use what you learned from the first scenario:

    * On graph paper, restate the problem situation in your own words.
    * Be sure to identify the **variables**, the **inequalities**, graph the **feasible
      region**, identify the **vertices** and **objective function**, and the
      **solution**.
    * Show all work!
