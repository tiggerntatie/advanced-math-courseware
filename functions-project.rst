PROJECT: Translations and Transformations
=========================================

In this project you will use the transformations we have covered in this unit
to create a poster for the classroom. This is an individual project, but you 
may discuss it with anyone in the class.

1. Draw a "parent function" on 8.5 x 11 inch graph paper. The "parent function"
   needs to include at least three line segments.

2. Identify five coordinates in the original "parent function". The five points
   must form a function even if the "parent function" does not. On a separate
   sheet, create a table of values using these coordinates. The column headings
   should be *x* and *f(x)*.
   
3. Now use **transformations** to add other shapes to the graph.
   You need to include at least:
   
   A. One **vertical stretch**: *a(x)*
   B. One **horizontal stretch**: *b(x)*
   C. One **horizontal shift**: *h(x)*
   D. One **vertical shift**: *k(x)*
   E. The **inverse**: If the five points of the **inverse** form a function, 
      label it as :math:`f^{-1}(x)`.
      Otherwise label the inverse INV(*f(x)*)
   F. One **combination** of transformations: *g(x)*
      
      Use at least two of these transformation types:
      
      (1) Translations
      (2) Stretches
      (3) Reflections
      
4. Create a new table of values for each transformation, applying the 
   transformation, applying the transformation to the coordinates. 
   Label each table as A, B, C, D, E, F.
   For column headings, write each transformation in terms of the "parent 
   function" *f(x)*
   
       For example, :math:`c(x) = 2f(x-1)+3`
   
5. Your final draft will be a copy of your design onto large graph paper. 
   Use colors, shading, etc., to make it more interesting!

    1. Your rough draft (the small graph)
    2. A sheet with the following:

       * The original coordinates in a table of values.
       * The equation for each transformation in terms of the "parent function".
       * The corresponding table of values for each transformation (labeled).

    3. The large graph.

    Make sure you put your name on everything!
